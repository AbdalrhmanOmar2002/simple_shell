# Simple Shell

This is a basic UNIX command line interpreter, commonly known as a shell, developed as part of a project requirement.

## Features

- Displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command.
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- Command lines are simple, with no semicolons, pipes, redirections, or other advanced features.
- Command lines are made only of one word; no arguments will be passed to programs.
- If an executable cannot be found, an error message is printed, and the prompt is displayed again.
- Handles errors gracefully.
- Handles the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).
